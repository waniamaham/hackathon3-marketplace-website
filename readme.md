## **Sanity and Next.js Interaction Workflow for Furniture Website:**
Content Management in Sanity

Sanity acts as the central content hub for managing your furniture-related data, such as product details (e.g., name, description, images), categories, and pricing.
Fetching Data in Next.js

Next.js fetches data from Sanity via GROQ (GraphQL-like query language) to retrieve structured, content-rich data. This ensures that product information, categories, and other details are always up-to-date.
Server-side Rendering (SSR)

For dynamic pages such as:
Product detail pages.
Individual furniture pieces with specific descriptions, images, and related information.
These pages fetch data on the server side, ensuring that users always receive the most current content.
Static Site Generation (SSG)

Pages such as:
Home page.
Category pages (e.g., "Sofas," "Tables").
These pages are pre-rendered at build time to improve performance and SEO.
Real-time Updates

Sanity's webhooks or event-based updates trigger real-time changes in the Next.js application, ensuring that content is automatically updated without requiring a manual deploy.
Rendering Components

Next.js components dynamically render content based on the data fetched from Sanity. This could include:
Product cards with images and prices.
Category filters.
User reviews and ratings for furniture pieces.
Example Flow:
A user visits a product detail page:

The page makes a server-side request to fetch product data from Sanity.
Details such as name, description, images, and pricing are dynamically rendered in the UI.
On the home page:

A static version of the page is pre-rendered at build time using data fetched from Sanity about popular furniture items, categories, and promotions.
Real-time Updates:

When an administrator updates a product description or adds a new furniture item in Sanity, the application reflects these changes immediately through webhooks.
